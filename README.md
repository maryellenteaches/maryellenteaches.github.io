### Learner Feedback
"Just finished your course **Creating Your First RESTful Spring Boot Microservice with JPA**. Your explanation of the topics were very clear and concise. You stayed on topic, gave just enough nitty-gritty without overexplaining and wasting time on irrelevant. One of the few courses I didn't have to fast-forward to find useful parts :) I really got boost to some topic areas I've been struggling with in my Spring project. I'll most definitely also watch your recently published course **Extending, Securing and Dockerizing Spring Boot Microservices** - exactly what I need to do next with my own project.
Congrats and big thanks for being a great instructor!"
